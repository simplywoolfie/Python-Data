# California Housing Prices Prediction
## Description

This repository contains an in-depth exploration and predictive analysis of the California Housing Prices dataset, sourced from Kaggle. The primary objective of this project is to build a predictive model to estimate the median housing prices in California districts, based on a variety of features. This work is executed in a Jupyter Notebook environment using Python, with special emphasis on Linear Regression and Random Forests algorithms.
## Project Overview

The California Housing Prices dataset offers a comprehensive collection of features related to housing in various districts of California. This project aims to dissect this dataset, visualize and interpret its patterns, and finally, build robust predictive models using Linear Regression and Random Forests.
## Methodology

This project leverages the power of Python and its popular libraries for data science and machine learning tasks. The entire analysis and modeling process is conducted in a Jupyter Notebook, which enables seamless integration of code, visualizations, and narrative text.

Key Python Libraries used in this project include:

    Pandas for data manipulation and analysis
    NumPy for numerical computation
    Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization
    Scikit-learn for implementing machine learning algorithms and model evaluation

## Data

The data used in this project is the California Housing Prices dataset from Kaggle. The dataset includes features such as median income, average number of rooms per dwelling, average number of bedrooms, population, and median house prices, among others.
Models

Two machine learning models, Linear Regression and Random Forests, are used for the predictive analysis. Linear Regression is a straightforward and interpretable model, while Random Forests are capable of capturing more complex patterns in the data. The performance of both models is evaluated and compared.
## Usage

To view the project, you can clone this repository and run the Jupyter Notebook. The notebook contains all the code, detailed comments, and explanations for each step of the data exploration, preprocessing, model building, and evaluation process.
## Contributions

Contributions, issues, and feature requests are welcome! If you have any suggestions for improving the models or exploring the data in different ways, please feel free to open an issue or create a pull request.
