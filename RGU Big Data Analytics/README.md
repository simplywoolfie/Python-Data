# Breast Cancer Prediction Project

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook based Python project focused on the prediction of breast cancer. The main goal of this project is to design, implement, and evaluate machine learning models for predicting breast cancer, one of the most common cancer types in women worldwide.

This was a coursework submission for RGU. The coursework compared Random Forest, Logistic Regression and Decision Tree classifiers to determine the most accure learning model for detecting breast cancer in women.
