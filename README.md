# Robert Gordon University Coursework and Personal Projects

## Description
Welcome to my GitHub repository! This is a compilation of my personal projects and coursework from my studies at Robert Gordon University, with a strong focus on Python and Data Analysis. Here, you will find a diverse range of assignments, projects, and experiments that I have conducted, demonstrating my growing skills and knowledge in data science and Python programming.

## Technologies Used
   <b>Python:</b> The primary programming language used for all projects. Python's extensive library support and easy-to-understand syntax make it an excellent choice for data analysis and machine learning.

   <b>Jupyter Notebook:</b> An open-source web application that allows the creation and sharing of documents that contain both code (e.g., python or R) and rich text elements (paragraphs, equations, figures, links, etc...).

   <b>Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-Learn:</b> These are some of the libraries used for data manipulation, analysis, and visualization.
